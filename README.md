## User Authentication System - MERN Stack

This is a beginner-level project that demonstrates how to implement a user authentication system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project covers essential features like user registration, login, and token-based authentication (JWT), allowing users to securely sign up and sign in.

### Features:
- **User Registration**: Users can create an account by providing their details, which are stored securely in MongoDB.
- **Login**: Existing users can log in using their credentials.
- **JWT Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens for secure, stateless authentication.

### Technologies Used:
- **MongoDB**: Database to store user data.
- **Express**: Backend framework to handle API requests and routing.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication for secure user sessions.

Feel free to modify it based on any additional features or changes in your project!
